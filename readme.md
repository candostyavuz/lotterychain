## Start Lottery Chain

Start the chain locally with

```
ignite chain serve --reset-once
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts the blockchain in development.
The blockchain (devnet) is configured with `config.yml`. Currently it has 20 client test accounts and a single validator account.

## Modules

**Lottery** module includes handler and keeper implementation of `EnterLottery` transactions. The module also includes storage objects for `Lottery` object and `Participant` object. 

`./x/lottery/abci.go` includes `EndBlocker` routine for determining the lottery winners and for distributing the reward payouts if the conditions are met. 

**Cosmos SDK Modules**: The chain utilizes methods from the native Cosmos SDK modules, `x/bank` and `x/staking`, for asset transactions and validator set retrieval to prevent block proposers from participating in the lottery.

## EnterLottery Transaction

**CLI Format**
`lotterychaind tx lottery enter-lottery [fee] [bet] [flags]`

**Transaction Rules**
* Block proposers are not allowed to join the lottery as participants. Active validator set is constantly being checked by the module.
* `fee` must be `5000000token` (10^6 decimal fields included)
* `bet` must be between `1_000_000token` and `100_000_000token` (10^6 decimal fields included)
* Each user can only participate once in the lottery session. 
* **If multiple transactions are sent from the same address:**
    - Only last transaction counts and last sent `bet` amount will be recorded in the `Participant` object.
    - Previous `bet` that user paid will be refunded back to its wallet.
    - Any `fee` paid to contract is NOT refunded and stored in the lottery prize pool.
    - If previous `bet` of the user is max / min bet of the current lottery session, the new min/max bet is automatically adjusted based on the current bets in the pool and last bet amount in the participant transaction.
* After total transaction count in the lottery hits 10 (or greater), `EndBlocker` is triggered and winner is detected according to modulus of hash of all appended txData with total number of transactions.
* Payment is done according to rules below:
    - If winner has the highest bet, entire pool including all the `fee` and `bet` is paid to winner.
    - If winner has the lowest bet, nothing is paid to winner and lottery prize pool is carried over to next session.
    - Any other winner bet case, all the `bet` amount (excluding `fee`) in the prize pool is paid to winner.
    - All funds are stored in the `lottery` module.
